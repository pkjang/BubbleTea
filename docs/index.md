<h1>Parkour using Observations(and Video Producer)</h1>
<p>For this project, I will be implementing different ways for a Minecraft agent to 
  traverse a series of treacherous jumps using the Malmo built in Video Producer feature as well
  as grid observations. For the first part of testing, I will mostly be experimenting with the basic 
  movement functions built into ContinuousMovementCommands and DiscreteMovementCommands. For the second
  half of testing, I will try to incorporate object detection using Video Producers.
</p>


Here is the obstacle course for basic movement.

A future test for the agent that will include turning and hopefully sprint jumping.
